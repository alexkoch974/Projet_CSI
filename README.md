# Compression and Decrompression of 3D meshes

Implementation of the method presented in the article *Progressive Compression of Arbitrary Triangular Meshes* by **Daniel Cohen-Or**, **David Levin**, and **Ofﬁr Remez**.

My team, Christophe Pantel, Edgar Remy, Clément Broutin and I coded the compression algorithm in the file *compresseur.py*.

The file *server.py* is written by Remy Alcouffe.
